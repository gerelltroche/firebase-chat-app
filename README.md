# Quick Firebase Chat-App

This project was created with React, and uses Firebase for its authentication and database.

The login on the firebase db side included a ban list in order to ban users, however i didn't bother implementing it on the front-end since i have this app mostly working. It could use polish, but it's a good place to start from. (Could use an environment file if i'll copy this to another project.)
